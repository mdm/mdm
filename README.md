## Marc Dominik Migge

Hi! I'm Marc Migge, a software engineer from Cologne, Germany.

I have been programming since my early teens, using various languages. My favorite for while now has been 🦀[**Rust**](https://rust-lang.org/)🦀. By trade I'm a web developer, but I like to dabble in all kinds of software development - from embedded to compilers.

## Projects 🌱
- [Confidante](https://github.com/mdm/confidante) - A work-in-progress **XMPP server**, aiming to be fully standards-compliant.
- [Ronald](https://github.com/mdm/ronald) - An **Amstrad CPC emulator**. The CPC was my first computer, handed down from a relative. I learned programming on this  machine and have fond memories typing in listings from magazines.
